## Upgrading to v2
With v2, I've moved the entire library over to be written in ES6 so components can be easily reused with having the
library internals be a proper class. Unfortunately, this has made v2 incompatibe with v1, but thankfully only a few
minor things have changed with the API.

1. Instead of calling the library as `s = Showtimes(location)`, you must now instantiate the class with `s = new Showtimes(location)`.
2. The `genre` response that comes back from API calls is now represented as an array instead of a compounded string.
